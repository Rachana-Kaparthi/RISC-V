<summary> Installation of RISC_V tools</summary>  

Steps to install Risc-tools (linux)

```
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/riscv_workshop_collaterals.git
cd riscv_workshop_collaterals
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh

```

 Once you run it you will get make error. ignore it  and type the following command

 ```

cd ~/riscv_toolchain/iverilog/
git checkout --track -b v10-branch origin/v10-branch
git pull 
chmod 777 autoconf.sh 
./autoconf.sh 
./configure 
make
sudo make install

```

- To set the PATH variable in .bashrc

```

gedit .bashrc
#Instead of rachana put your username
export PATH="/home/rachana/riscv_toolchain/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.3.0-2019.08.0-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14/bin:$PATH"
#Type at last line # close the bashrc and type
source .bashrc

```

 <summary>Introduction to Risc-V</summary>  
 The RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is an open and royalty-free instruction set architecture designed for use in computer processors. It is based on the principles of Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC), which aims to simplify the processor's instruction set, making it easier to design, implement, and optimize processors. Below is the list of instructions used in Risc-V:  
 1.  
 2.
